Assisted with the development of the curriculum, as well as initial wireframes, file structure, app features, and many other items. One of the features I had the most fun developing was the user creation flow when a user is created and a personalized IDE is created on the fly for the user. This IDE lives on the cloud and is accessible from any device so the student/user can code on a live environment from anywhere. The personalized IDE can handle multiple languages from JavaScript to Python, PHP, and C++.",

I built a dynamic infographic where when you pick a NEO you could see there features compared to real-life objects. For example, if the NEO was extremely large it would compare its size with Texas and let you know it x amount of times as big as Texas.",
